* From the dashboard / home page, click on "Create a resource"
* In the search bar, search for "Bing Search" and select "Bing Search v7"
* Click "Create"
  * Enter a name for your service
  * Select your existing subscription
  * Choose a pricing tier according to your needs (Free tier should fit in most cases)
  * Choose an existing Resource Group or create a new
  * Check the box to confirm conditions
  * Create
* Go to the resource after it has been created
  * Select "Key and EndPoint"
  * Copy one of the two keys (doesn't matter, both will work)
